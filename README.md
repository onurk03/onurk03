- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @onurk03
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently an freshman Computer Sciences student at UW Madison.
- I use this github account to work on Java based class assignments across two different computers and store them on a private repository.
- I'm also learning Web Development (HTML/CSS/Javascript) at the same time as my public repositories suggest.
